Trip Service Kata
=================

Kata for legacy code hands-on session. The objective is to test and refactor the legacy TripService class.

This kata is originally introduced by [Sandro Mancuso](https://github.com/sandromancuso). I've just taken the PHP version and restructure it to get more idiomatic.

# Getting Started

In order to perform the kata, first of all you will need to install all of the dependencies. This can be done using
composer:

```shell
wget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
php composer.phar install
```

Next, to execute the unit tests you need run this:

    vendor/bin/phpunit
